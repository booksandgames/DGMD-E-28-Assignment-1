        <h3>Who I Am, Where I'm From, and What I've Studied</h3>
        <p>
          Hello world! My name is Wes. I'm originally from Kansas, but I'm
          currently living in Iowa. My bachelor's degree is in sociology, but
          I'm hoping to start a degree program in the fall as a computer science
          major.

        <h3>Web Development Experience</h3>
        <p>
          This semester is the first time I am taking college/university level
          courses in computer science. I did, however, complete a three-month
          long coding bootcamp that focused on full-stack JavaScript, so I have
          used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before. Because of the short nature of
          the bootcamp I attended, I know there are still significant gaps in my
          knowledge that I am hoping to fill in.

        <h3>Software Engineering Experience</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to this course, I also am currently enrolled in
          Introduction to Computer Science Using Python. Several months ago, I
          graduated from a coding bootcamp during which a team of other students
          and I completed a group project to build an open-source product. I
          studied single-page applications during a very brief two-day unit in
          the bootcamp, so I have been introduced to what they are, but I am
          excited to learn about them in much greater detail this semester.

        <h3>Why I Want to Take This Course</h3>
        <p>
          I'm excited to take this course because I'm curious to learn more
          about single-page applications since they were only covered very
          briefly during the software engineering bootcamp I completed. I also
          want to learn more about the technologies the course will cover like
          React.js.

          rose garden that we visited the last time I traveled there.

          I have been a vegetarian for several years now. I really enjoy Indian
          cuisine both because I really enjoy the flavor of the food but also
          because there are a lot of vegetarian options to choose from.
